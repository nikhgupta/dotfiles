# My Dot Castle

**castle for my dotfiles** - the cornetstone of _dev-kind_ ! :)

This repository contains the dotfiles _(stolen/compiled/created)_ by me.
Major inspirations from [@holman](http://github.com/holman) and
[@mathiasybnens](http://github.com/mathiasbynens). More inspirations
from [dotfiles repository](http://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) by
[@skwp](http://github.com/skwp). Credit has been given where I could. :)

To install, run:

    git clone https://github.com/nikhgupta/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## Pre-setup

These dotfiles used to target osx (`v1`), ubuntu/archlinux (`v2`), WSL
(`v3`), etc., but with `v4` - I have exclusively settled on using
Archlinux base now. For a quick setup, I do employ Manjaro Architect at
times, which sets up a base Archlinux install for me with a minimal
Gnome shell.

At the moment, I am using a Lenovo Legion Y530 laptop, which I have
really started liking as opposed to my earlier Macbook Airs. The Legion
Y530 laptop has 2 graphic cards, which makes me favor Manjaro vs Arch,
due to automatic hardware detection and drivers setup.

These dotfiles expect a minimal Gnome setup with either Archlinux or
Manjaro, but do allow setting up a tiling window manager - which I use
primarily. The Gnome session is serves as a backup, if needed.
