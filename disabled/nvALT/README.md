### Lopash for nvALT

The Lopash theme was originally created by [Erik Sagen](http://www.kartooner.com) for [Marked](http://markedapp.com), and modified by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com) for use with [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/).

This version is copyright Brett Terpstra, 2013. It is free for unlimited use with nvALT, but may not be re-purposed or published without permission.

### What you'll get

* The Lopash theme from the upcoming version of [Marked](http://markedapp.com), complete with custom web fonts.
* Automatic highlighting of code blocks with [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)
* A basic implementation of [Widon't](http://shauninman.com/archive/2006/08/22/widont_wordpress_plugin) for headlines.
* Smooth scrolling when clicking footnotes and anchors.
* A "back to top" link that appears when scrolling down a note.

### Installation

First, back up any custom files you've created previously. You can always restore the default just by deleting the `custom.css` and `template.html` files from `[User Home]/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`.

Copy the files in the zip folder to `[User Home]/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`. If the "nvALT" folder doesn't exist, create it or simply drag the folder you unzipped into **[User Home]→Library→Application Support**.

You should have the following files in your Support folder:

    custom.css
    highlight.pack.js
    jquery.min.js
    solarized_dark.css
    solarized_light.css
    template.html

Solarized Light is included in case you prefer it with the theme, and can be switched in with a quick edit in template.html (near the top).

nvALT will automatically pick up this new theme even if it's already running. After switching notes you should see the change.
